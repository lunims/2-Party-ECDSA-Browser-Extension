# 2-Party-ECDSA-Browser-Extension

**Overview**

This browser extension is part of a Bachelor Thesis which implements a multi-party ECDSA signature on open source SoloKeys (https://github.com/solokeys/solo2). 
For this approach we need some middleware in order to intercept FIDO challenges and manage communication between the tokens which is the goal of this extension.
